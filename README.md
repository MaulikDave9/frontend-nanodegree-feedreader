#  FeedReader Testing Project  ##
In this project, learned how to use Jasmine framework to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation. The original developer of this application have already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and started writing their first test suite.  All the tests were written in ...jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.
